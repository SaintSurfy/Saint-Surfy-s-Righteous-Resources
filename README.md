# Saint Surfy's Righteous Resources

## (Note: This repository is now archived as I think having this along with the neocities site slows down the development of the website. I want people to see the website slowly growing so I can get feedback on how improve. The Github respository might become active one day but at the moment I think it's just slowing me down. If you want to download the source code for the website I will be providing a zip file for every single update that includes the source code in place of the link that originally led here)
### This is the source code for my website for newly-converted Christians. Not much of the things on the website are mine anyway so everythings free to use
